# Li Jinpei's Website

Welcome to Li Jinpei's personal website. I will record and share some learning experience about compilation techniques/algorithms/programming here. Wish you will enjoy it.

[LLVM Study](llvm/index.html) My learning notes on LLVM.

[Multi Processor Programming](mp/index.html) Shared-memory multi-processor programming. I don't care what you call it, concurrent/parallel/multi-thread/processor, it's just multi-processor programming modeled by shared-memory, distinguished from the message-passing model. Also I don't care much about things like "in fact, shared-memory is implemented by message-passing", that's a seperate problem.

[C++ Study](cpp/index.html)

[Linux Kernel Study](linux/index.html) My learning notes on linux kernel.

[Scheme Study](scheme/index.html) My learning notes on the Scheme programming language.

[Tools](tools/index.html) CMake/gdb/etc.
